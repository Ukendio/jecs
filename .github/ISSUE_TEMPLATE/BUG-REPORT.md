## Describe the bug

## Reproduction

Make an easy-to-follow guide on how to reproduce it. Does it happen all the time? Will specific features affect reproduction? All these questions should be answered for a good issue.

This is a good place to put rbxl files or scripts that help explain your reproduction steps.
