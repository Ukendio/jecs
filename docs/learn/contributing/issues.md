# Submitting Issues

When you're submitting an issue, generally they fall into a few categories:

## Bug

We need some information to figure out what's going wrong. At a minimum, you need to tell us:

        (1) What's supposed to happen

        (2) What actually happened

        (3) Steps to reproduce


Stack traces and other useful information that you find make a bug report more likely to be fixed.

Consult the template for a bug report if you don't know or have questions about how to format this.

## Documentation

Depending on how you go about it, this can be done as a [Pull Request](../contributing/pull-requests) instead of an issue. Generally, we need to know what was wrong, what you changed, and how it improved the documentation if it isn't obvious.

We just need to know what's wrong. You should fill out a [PR](../contributing/pull-requests) if you know what should be there instead.
